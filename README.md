# Interactive-GUI-for-Advanced-Sorting-Algorithms-DSA-Visualizer-

Interactive PyGame-based GUI to visualize popular and advanced sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort. This tool helps students, developers, and educators understand sorting algorithms through real-time, step-by-step animations.

## Features
- Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort visualizations.
- Dark Mode UI: Eye-friendly dark-themed interface.
- Real-time Statistics: Track comparisons, swaps, and elapsed time during sorting.
- Algorithm-Specific Controls: Start, pause, reset, and step through each algorithm.
- User-Friendly Interface: Responsive GUI built with PyGame.
- Educational Tool: Ideal for learning and teaching DSA concepts.

## Getting Started
- Requires Python and PyGame.
- Run the main script to launch the visualizer.
- Select the sorting algorithm and use the controls to start the visualization.

## Why Use This Visualizer?
It makes understanding sorting algorithms easier by visually demonstrating element movements, comparisons, and sorting progression in real time.
